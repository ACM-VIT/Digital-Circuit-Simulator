Start your dev server and test these scenarios:

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Test Cases:**
- âœ… Create a category â†’ Should show green success toast
- âœ… Delete a category â†’ Should show confirmation modal, then success toast
- âœ… Delete a circuit â†’ Should show confirmation modal, then success toast
- âœ… Move circuit to category â†’ Should show success toast
- âœ… Try loading a non-existent circuit â†’ Should show red error toast
- âœ… Network error scenarios â†’ Should show error toasts

### 2. Take Screenshots for PR

Capture screenshots of:

1. **Success Toast** - Creating a category
   - Green toast notification at top-right
   
2. **Error Toast** - Loading error or failed operation
   - Red toast notification at top-right

3. **Confirmation Modal** - Deleting a circuit

```

## Toast Notification Customization

If you want to customize the toast appearance, edit `components/ToastProvider.tsx`:

- **Position**: `position="top-right"` (can be top-left, bottom-right, etc.)
- **Duration**: `duration: 4000` (milliseconds)
- **Colors**: Modify the `style` and `iconTheme` objects
- **Animation**: Controlled by `react-hot-toast` internally

## Manual Usage

You can use toasts anywhere in your app:

```typescript
import toast from 'react-hot-toast';

// Success
toast.success('Operation completed!');

// Error
toast.error('Something went wrong');

// Loading
toast.loading('Processing...');

// Custom
toast('Custom message', { icon: 'ðŸ”¥' });
```

## Notes

- All toasts auto-dismiss after the configured duration
- Users can manually dismiss by clicking the toast
- Toasts stack automatically if multiple appear
- Position is responsive and works on mobile
- The dark theme matches your app's aesthetic
